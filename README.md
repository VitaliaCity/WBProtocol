# 🛠️🌍 World Builder Protocol

Vitalia is building a decentralized city for biotech acceleration. Vitalia’s first hub is in a special jurisdiction with pro-crypto and pro-technology laws. Vitalia uses crypto to overcome a big problem: access to finance for real-world infrastructure (e.g., clinics, labs, residential). To solve this problem, Vitalia is building a protocol that allows crypto crowdfunding and tokenization/collateralization of real-world assets against which to borrow money.
